    '''Guess the position of the central object as two-step process

    First, this function calculates the center of mass of an image.
    This works well if the central object is the only bright source, however
    even a moderately bright source that is far away can shift the center of
    mass of an image by a few pixels. To improve the first guess the function
    selects a subimage with the halfwidth ``halfwidth`` in a second step
    and calculates the center of mass of that subimage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : 2d np.array
        input image
    halfwidth : int
        half width of the subimage selected in the second step.

    Returns
    -------

        x and y coordinates estimated position of the central object

    '''fit a diffraction spike with a line

    Regions with low signal, i.e. regions where the maximum is not well
    determined (standard deviation < 40% percentile indicates that all pixels
    in that strip are very similar, meaning that these pixels contain mostly
    sky and not signal).


    Parameters
    ----------
    image : np.array
        2 dimensional image
    fac : float
        Initial guess for the parameter m in the equation y = m*x+b.
    r_inner, r_outer : float
        The fit is done on the left side of the image from ``-r_outer`` to
        ``-r_inner`` and on the right side from ``+r_inner`` to ``+r_outer``
        (all coordinates in pixels, measured from the center of the image).
        Use these parameters to contrain the fit to a region with a strong, but
        not saturated signal.
    width : float
        For each column in the image, a ``width`` strip of pixels centered on the
        initial guess is extracted and the position of the maximum is recorded.
    initial guess : tuple or callable
        This can either be a numeric value for an initial guess such as
        ``(54, 67.7)`` for a function that accepts and 2 d array (the image)
        and returns an tuple.

    Returns
    -------
    m, b : float
        coefficients for a line of the form y = m x + b
